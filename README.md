# kubehomedns

This project addresses the challenge of exposing local Kubernetes ingress to an external network when using a dynamic IP provided by most ISPs. It automatically creates and updates ingress records with your public IP on Cloudflare. Existing tools were either too complex or lacked required functionality. Additionally, this project serves as a learning opportunity for developing in Go.

To be continued.
